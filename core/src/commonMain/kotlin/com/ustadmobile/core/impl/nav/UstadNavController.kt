/**
 * Interface to form the basis of a multiplatform wrapper for Jetpack's NavController. To handle
 * SavedState, navigation.
 *
 * Structure is intended to be similar to Android JetPack navigation. On Android this is implemented
 * using an Adapter over the real NavController. On Javascript this will use window.location, react
 * router, and its own code for savedstate and history tracking.
 *
 * ViewName refers to the VIEWNAME on the View interface. ViewName is used the same as a destination
 * id on Android.
