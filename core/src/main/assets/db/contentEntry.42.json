knowledge of arrays.  In Topic A, students initially use repeated addition to find the total from a number of equal groups (2.OA.4).  As students notice patterns, they let go of longer addition sentences in favor of more efficient multiplication facts (3.OA.1).  Lessons in Topic A move students’ Grade 2 work with arrays and repeated addition a step further by developing skip-counting rows as a strategy for multiplication.  Arrays become a cornerstone of the module.  Students use the language of multiplication as they understand what factors are and differentiate between the size of groups and the number of groups within a given context.  In this module, the factors 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and  10 provide an entry point for moving into more difficult factors in later modules.\"  Eureka Math/EngageNY (c) 2015 GreatMinds.org","entryId":"engage-3rd-module-1","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"https://www.khanacademy.org/math/k-8-grades/engageny/on-grade-engageny/3rd-engage-ny/engage-3rd-module-1","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/genfiles/topic-icons/icons/multiplication_division.png-43eb1f-128c.png","lastModified":1548860267451,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":false,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":16507,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533697412,"title":"Triple integrals","description":"Triple integrals are the analog of double integrals for three dimensions.  They are a tool for adding up infinitely many infinitesimal quantities associated with points in a three-dimensional region.","entryId":"triple-integrals","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"khan-id://x9602e91b","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/Bhve0sduqVw_20f8WSAsISMWSDt1QsoUoaDWu_2LnD9WIsObLVrBGrs08wi4vNme4c_VOkYssuwc-iZR5FCtLRYN","lastModified":1548860268708,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":true,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":16508,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533697411,"title":"Stokes\u0027 theorem (articles)","description":"You\u0027ve worked so hard to get to this point, and finally, you\u0027re here.

This connection between the measurement tool and the numerical work lays an important foundation for success with middle-school geometry and algebra.

They explore many examples of functions and their graphs, focusing on the contrast between linear and exponential functions. They interpret functions given graphically, numerically, symbolically, and verbally; translate between representations; and understand the limitations of various representations.\" Eureka Math/EngageNY (c) 2015 GreatMinds.org","entryId":"alg1-3","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"https://www.khanacademy.org/math/k-8-grades/engageny/on-grade-engageny/engageny-alg-1/alg1-3","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/genfiles/topic-icons/icons/exponential_logarithmic.png-b3d38d-128c.png","lastModified":1548860332043,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":false,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":16694,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533697225,"title":"Module 7: Introduction to irrational numbers using geometry","description":"\"By Module 7 students have been using the Pythagorean Theorem for several months.

They explore (with appropriate tools) the effects of transformations on graphs of exponential and logarithmic functions.  They notice that the transformations on a graph of a logarithmic function relate to the logarithmic properties (F-BF.B.3).  Students identify appropriate types of functions to model a situation.  They adjust parameters to improve the model, and they compare models by analyzing appropriateness of fit and making judgments about the domain over which a model is a good fit.  The description of modeling as, “the process of choosing and using mathematics and statistics to analyze empirical situations, to understand them better, and to make decisions,” is at the heart of this module.  In particular, through repeated opportunities in working through the modeling cycle (see page 61 of the CCLS), students acquire the insight that the same mathematical or statistical structure can sometimes model seemingly different situations.\" Eureka Math/EngageNY (c) 2015 GreatMinds.org","entryId":"alg2-3","author":"","publisher":"Khan Academy","licenseType":4,"licenseName":"","licenseUrl":"","sourceUrl":"https://www.khanacademy.org/math/k-8-grades/engageny/on-grade-engageny/engageny-alg2/alg2-3","thumbnailUrl":"https://cdn.kastatic.org/genfiles/topic-icons/icons/exponential_logarithmic.png-b3d38d-128c.png","lastModified":1548860333398,"primaryLanguageUid":-4103245208651561181,"languageVariantUid":0,"leaf":false,"publik":true,"contentTypeFlag":0,"contentEntryLocalChangeSeqNum":0,"contentEntryMasterChangeSeqNum":16700,"contentEntryLastChangedBy":-892023645},{"contentEntryUid":-3831212382533697219,"title":"Module 5: A synthesis of modeling with equations and functions","description":"\"In Module 5, students synthesize what they have learned during the year about functions to select the correct function type in a series of modeling problems.
