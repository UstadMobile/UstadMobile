## Contributing

We welcome contributions! There are many ways you can help, even if you're not a developer! We
welcome developers, translators, bug reports, and feature suggestions. You an always reach us on
Discord here: [https://discord.gg/WHe35Sbsg4](https://discord.gg/WHe35Sbsg4).

## For developers

### What you need to know

As a developer you should be familiar with Kotlin and Android development, ideally you should have 
an understanding of Kotlin Multiplatform. Jetpack compose is used on Android and the React and
Material UI are used on the web client. You should know SQL as the app is database-driven.

### Submitting pull requests

Please contact us first before working on it! This way we can check that it is in scope and ensure
it is implemented in a way that works for all users. Please see the
[PULLREQUEST-CHECKLIST.md](PULLREQUEST-CHECKLIST.md) and ensure that development follows 
[CODING-STYLE.md](CODING-STYLE.md).

## For translators

Translation can help us support for educators and learners! Translation is done using on our Weblate
project. Please register on Weblate and then create an issue with the subject 
"Localization - language name" and let us know what language you would like to translate into. 
We can then give you permission to start translating!
