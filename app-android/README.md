# Ustad Mobile Android module

This provides the app for Android. Fragments, activities, services, etc. are here. This is then 
used as the main dependency for app-android-launcher that provides the APK. It could in theory
be used as a dependency in another app.

### To build

(run from root project directory):

```
 $ ./gradlew ':app-android:assembleDebug'
```
