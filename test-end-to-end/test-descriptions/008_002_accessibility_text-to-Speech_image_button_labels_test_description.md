# Accessibility: Text-to-Speech and Image Button Labels

## Description:

Screens support the use of text-to-speech as provided by the operating system (e.g. Windows, Android). Image buttons are labeled appropriately for speech readers.

## Step-by-Step Procedure:

1. **Enable text-to-speech on your operating system:**
    - **Windows:** Go to `Settings > Ease of Access > Narrator` and turn on the Narrator.
    - **Android:** Go to `Settings > Accessibility > Text-to-Speech Output` and enable text-to-speech.
2. Login to app as admin.
3. Navigate through various screens in the app: Ensure that text content is read aloud accurately by the text-to-speech feature.
4. Check that each image button has an appropriate label that is read by the text-to-speech. 
5. Labels should be descriptive of the button's function (e.g., "Submit," "Open Menu"). 
6. Confirm that the text-to-speech correctly announces the button labels when focused or hovered over. 
7. Ensure that all text-based content (e.g., menu options, labels) is read correctly. 
8. Verify that dynamic content updates are announced by text-to-speech as needed. 
9. Navigate between screens and interact with different elements to ensure consistent text-to-speech functionality.
