## Maestro end-to-end testing for Android

The end-to-end tests for the Android app are built using [Maestro](https://maestro.mobile.dev/) and
generate reports. The scripts have been written and tested on Linux. They may work on other systems,
but that has not been thoroughly tested.

### Prerequisites:

* Install Maestro as per the [official instructions](https://maestro.mobile.dev/getting-started/installing-maestro).
* Build the android release apk from the [app-android](../app-android/) module and the
  HTTP server from the [app-ktor-server](../app-ktor-server/) module. This would be done by the normal
  **gradlew build** command.
* Start an Android emulator or connect a physical device and get the serial of the device (e.g. using the **adb devices** command)
* MacOS only: install the realpath command.

### Run all tests:

```
$ ./run-maestro-test.sh --serial1 emulator-5554
```
Where emulator-5554 is the serial of the emulator as per the **adb devices** command.

Options:

* **--test** specify a test to run as per the test flows found in e2e-tests e.g. --test 001_001_admin_can_add_content_001-h5p
* **--apk** specify a particular apk file to test and install. By default the test runner expects to
 use the release APK file built from source
* **--console-output** use Maestro console output instead of saving to a JUnit XML. Helpful to see 
more verbose output when designing/running/debugging flows etc.

 **Output**

Result artifacts (screenshots, screen recording, etc) will be saved as follows:

* build/results/emulator-serial/report.xml - JUnit XML report for the given serial generated by Maestro
* build/results/emulator-serial/test-name - artifacts for each end-to-end test including screenshots
* build/results/emulator-serial/test-name/screenrecord.mp4 - screen recording of the end to end test

The combined report (with videos for each test) HTML will be saved to build/results/index.html 


### Run a single test using Maestro command line:

1. Build and install APK on emulator or device as per [app-android README](../../app-android)

2. Clear Data Folder in app-ktor-server:Start the server using runserver.sh or runserver.bat as per the [Main README development environment setup](../../README.md)

3. Run Maestro command to run test

```
cd test-end-to-end/android-maestro
maestro test e2e-tests/<test name>.yaml -e USERNAME=admin -e PASSWORD=testpass -e TESTSERIAL=emulator-5554 -e ENDPOINT=http://<ip address>:8087/
```

Replace the values for`PASSWORD` with the server admin password, `TESTSERIAL` with the emulator or device serial (as per adb devices command), `ENDPOINT` with the server url as per the --siteUrl parameter used with runserver.

### Resource IDs (testtags)

Editable fields: testTag should be the label, in snake_case
Date/time combined fields: two test tags - one for date, one for time e.g.  dont_show_before_date, 
dont_show_before_time
Rich text (click to move to edit): com.toughra.ustadmobile:id/text_input_edit_text
Rich text in editing screen: com.toughra.ustadmobile:id/editor

Buttons: testTag should be label_button
Floating action button: floating_action_button
Action bar button (e.g. save/done): action_bar_button
Title text: app_title

Exceptions:
Next/prev buttons on attendance edit: prev_day_button and next_day_button
Message list (chat) screen: textfield: message_text
PersonEdit: phone number is split into country code dropdown ( country_code ) and the in country
number (phone_number_text)
