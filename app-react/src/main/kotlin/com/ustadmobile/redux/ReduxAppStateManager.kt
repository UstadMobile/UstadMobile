/**
 * State management which uses Redux to manage state of an app. With Redux app states can be
 * accessed on all app components.
 *
 * To listen for state change, call subscribe() and pass your functional listener, this listener
 * will be invoked when state changes.
 * To change state, call dispatch() and pass your state to be changed
 *
 * In here we have a GlobalState which holds all state that can be changed by any component within
 * the app. Like FAB visibility, Title, FAB label, FAB icon and etc.
